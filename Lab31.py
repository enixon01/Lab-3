#A turtle appeared and the line ran in the directions I told it to the amount of units I dictated
#In the first line the turtle turned red
#The fred color command makes fred red
#Fred forward tells fred to move forward
#Fred right tells fred to move right.  IF we change the argument then it will go a different amount
